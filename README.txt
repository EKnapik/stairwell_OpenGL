So a couple of things to note. It takes a few seconds to render, it took about 10 seconds
on my computer before an image showed up. It will appear and I have included the one
that I created. The image is the base ground, the 4 pillars then the several sets of
stairs. I made all the objects and normals by hand or programming, I learned a lot.
Great assignment but I had some troubles with the UV coordinates for the cylinder
as can be seen with the resulting image. I didn't quite get the deffered rendering
to work but another day I guess.
